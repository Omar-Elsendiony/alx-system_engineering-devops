![Outage](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIG1.rCv3F4_8JF7QM6h7Wybv?w=1024&h=1024&rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain)
## Issue Summary:

# Duration: The outage occurred on April 15, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM (UTC).

# Impact: The outage affected the availability of our website, resulting in slow loading times and intermittent errors for users accessing our services. Approximately 30% of our users experienced service disruptions during this time.

# Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as a database connectivity issue resulting from a misconfiguration in the database connection pool settings.

## Timeline:

Detection Time: The issue was detected at 10:00 AM (UTC) when monitoring alerts indicated a spike in error rates and latency on our website.

Issue Detection: Monitoring systems triggered alerts for increased error rates and latency on the website, prompting immediate investigation by the on-call engineering team.

Actions Taken: The engineering team investigated various parts of the system, including frontend servers, backend services, and database servers. Initially, assumptions were made regarding potential network issues or server overload causing the slowdown.

Misleading Investigation Paths: Initial investigation focused on frontend and network components due to the symptom of slow loading times. However, subsequent analysis revealed no anomalies in these areas.

Escalation: As the issue persisted, it was escalated to the database administration team to inspect database server logs and configurations for any potential issues affecting connectivity.

Resolution: The issue was resolved by reconfiguring the database connection pool settings to ensure optimal connection handling and resource utilization. This adjustment restored normal database connectivity and resolved the website slowdowns.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The root cause of the issue was traced to a misconfiguration in the database connection pool settings, leading to exhausted database connections and subsequent service degradation.

Resolution: The issue was resolved by adjusting the database connection pool settings to optimize connection pooling and resource allocation. This prevented connection exhaustion and restored normal database connectivity, resolving the website slowdowns.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvement Areas:
Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect database connection issues proactively.
Implement automated testing of database connection settings during deployment to catch misconfigurations.
Enhance incident response procedures to expedite troubleshooting and resolution of similar issues in the future.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Implement automated alerts for monitoring database connection health and throughput.
Conduct regular audits of database connection pool configurations to ensure optimal settings.
Enhance documentation and knowledge sharing on troubleshooting database connectivity issues for the engineering team.
